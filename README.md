# Cluster-analysis-with-NGLS-open-data-to-group-PhD-student-career-outcomes
## Background
We'll work with NGLS open data to group the career outcomes of PhD students in the Life Sciences Programs of Duke University. The result of cluster analysis might be helpful for academic institutions and prospective PhD students.  
## Data Analytics Outline  
### **1. Research Questions**  
Is it possible to bring transparency to empower academic institutions to make better decisions about their PhD training programs? How can we group the open career outcomes data in order to inform perspective or current PhD students with a brighter future and broader opportunities? What policy or regulations can be designed to build a bridge between PhD students and an efficient job market?
### **2. Data Questions**
In this study, we explore the publishing career outcomes data of life science PhD training programs in Duke Uinversity. More specifically, we attempt to group the collecting data and analyze the potential characteristics of each category so as to provide some constructive suggestions for strengthening the biomedical workforce.

With comprehensive long-term career pathways information, programs could more effectively assess their own contribution to the profession. What is the comprehensive and recent picture of the career outcomes? Do the career outcomes of PhD students differ by cluster/discipline? Besides, how can perspective PhD students more fully understand his/her responding to the needs of the job market?  
### **3. K-means Clustering and Evaluation Metric**  
Cluster analysis can help us better understand natural groupings in our datasets based on defined variables. By allocating different data points into several clusters, it is possible to reveal the underlying relationship and characterize each group using certain matrics.  

Distance metrics plays a very important role in the clustering process. The more the similarity among the data in clusters, more the chances of particular data-items to belong to particular group. In general, [K-means](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-applications-evaluation-methods-and-drawbacks-aa03e644b48a) is a heuristic algorithm that partitions a data set into K clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distance in each cluster.
